Our ancestors tilled the soil for subsistence and later embraced farming as a vocation. Over the years, because of scientific breakthroughs, new technology, and improved systems, the number of people employed in farming has declined; still, the business of farming remains vital to our well-being as a people and a nation.\n\nMost of America's nearly two million farms are considered \"small,\" with seven out of ten grossing less than $50,000 a year. Despite their preponderance, operators of small farms have often felt neglected by our national farm programs. Sources of advice for farmers starting out have about dried up, with agricultural county agents admitting that they have time to service only full-time farmers—a group whose numbers are declining. The state departments of agriculture have marketing advice aplenty but are of little help to newcomers asking questions about credit, cropping recommendations, and cultural information. Needed are individual human beings whose hands are on the rural pulse and who have lots of information in their heads, but it remains to be seen who will train them or who will pay them. People have been spoiled for more than a century, recipients of free advice from the government, but that advice is gone now and won't be coming back.\n\nA big establishment and greater sales volume do not guarantee a corresponding increase in profits. Likewise, buying land and calling that land a farm cannot ensure that your investment will be profitable. The days of starting out on a few dollars are over, and farming is now complex. People in the business are specialists, and many even have training in business theory. Such is farming in 1999, and so it will be in the years to come.\n\nToday, as well as tomorrow, the most important piece of farm equipment is knowledge. Understanding complex situations or agribusiness production and marketing problems will be paramount to staying in business year after year. In this era of high technology, vacillating consumer wants and tastes, and shifting market conditions, farm managers and agricultural entrepreneurs are seeking help to cope with these and other situations. In the past—indeed, too frequently—people would \"shut the gate after the horse was out of the barn\" and then go look for the horse. Now, the preferred method is to have a plan of action in place before going to the barn—knowledge is the key.\n\nIt starts with you. You must decide what is good for you, your family, and the farm business before purchasing resources or even planting a seed. Anyone can own a farm and call themselves a farmer, but to become profitable you must acquire and apply business skills.\n\n_Making Your Small Farm Profitable_ is your road map for planning a successful journey into the vast and diverse landscape of agriculture in the years ahead. Ron Macher is a veteran farmer, a true friend of mine and yours, and a huge advocate of small farms. Ron has \"been there and done that\" for agriculture for many decades. He writes from the heart for the sole purpose of instructing and guiding novice entrepreneurs, wanna-bes, and tried and true \"dirt under the fingernails\" farm people. Ron, like me, is close to the earth—we are both proven small farm operators. We have been close friends and colleagues championing America's small farm community for many years. (Ron was in the private sector, while I served the public via the U.S. Department of Agriculture.)\n\nIn the early 1980s we witnessed the tragic loss of many family farms. Ron did not stand idly by as this occurred; rather, he launched a new publication aimed at Midwest farm families. The fledgling farm magazine _Missouri Farm_ grew in popularity, and later the magazine's name was changed to _Small Farm Today_ —now the industry bellwether.\n\nOver the years, with the advent of new crops and technology, Ron found that his working hours were increasingly devoted to being an executive, not a farmer. This role brought a new kind of obligation, and Ron soon felt the kind of responsibility he has today; he got a glimpse of the complicated future he and others would face in industrialized agriculture. Already, he was greatly disturbed by the failure of government, both federal and state, to provide the information that small farm operators required. He took it upon himself to meet that need and began editing and publishing his magazine, now in circulation for more than 15 years.\n\n_Making Your Small Farm Profitable_ is the outgrowth of Ron's vast experience in farming and his knowledge of journalism. Over the years, he learned how to share this experience and delegate the details of his business to others. Written for people who want to be profitable regardless of their farm status, novice or veteran, full-time or part-time, this book is your guide from the earliest stages of farming, when all things and topics are nebulous, to a genuine high point in farming—when you make a bank deposit, confirming that your small farm _is_ profitable.\n\nHoward W. \"Bud\" Kerr, Jr.  \nFormer Director, Office of Small-Scale Agriculture,  \nU.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n## Preface\n\nWhen you are disking a field to plant corn, the sun is shining, and the earth smells fresh, you are probably not thinking about whether that process will make you money. Farmers invariably find production agriculture more fun than the business side of farming, which involves heady subjects like marketing, sales, and cost evaluations. Still, to become a successful agripreneur, you'll need to learn to enjoy the business side of farming as well. It is my sincere hope that this book will help beginning and established farmers make their farms profitable and their livelihoods satisfying, moving us forward to a more consistently sustainable agriculture and ultimately fostering sustainable communities.\n\n### What Is Agripreneurship?\n\nAgripreneurship is the profitable marriage of agriculture and entrepreneurship—more plainly, turning your farm into a business. Most farmers regard agriculture as a combination of philosophy and lifestyle, so in its broadest sense agripreneurship binds together philosophy, lifestyle, and business, yielding ideals that give you purpose and goals to strive for. Agripreneurship is a mental attitude that can give you the strength and motivation to break from tradition.\n\n### About Sustainable Agriculture\n\nSustainable agriculture is a site-specific, whole-farm approach to agriculture. Land, people, goals, capital, crops, and livestock are managed to yield the best possible results on the farm. Not tied to any one model of agriculture, sustainable agriculture strives to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of the family farm.\n\nBy reducing inputs, sustainable agriculture encourages conservation and multiple uses of resources. It promotes diversity, using multiple species and natural methods to recycle matter and nutrients to maintain the land's productivity, now and in the future. Sustainable agriculture encourages local food production, providing food to society at a reasonable cost while supporting the farmer with an acceptable level of income. Finally, sustainable agriculture fosters a diverse and sustainable farming community as well as a sustainable society, drawing together farmers, lenders, consumers, and institutions in cooperative partnerships.\n\n### A Sustainable Community\n\nWhen considered strictly from an agricultural standpoint, we quickly recognize that society comprises four major groups: farmers, lenders, consumers, and institutions.\n\n  * Farmers are those who provide food and fiber to our nation. Their farms provide a reserve of natural habitat for wildlife, supply oxygen, and act as filters for our watersheds. Farmers instill in their children a strong work ethic and a good set of values.\n\n  * Lenders are important suppliers of start-up capital for companies of all sorts. In agriculture, lenders supply monies to agripreneurs and processing facilities, allowing farmers to sell their products directly at retail prices.\n\n  * Consumers are those who buy the products that individual farmers and institutions produce. Consumers provide farmers with the income they need to continue their operations.\n\n  * Institutions include universities, government agencies, and businesses. Institutions create consumer goods, add value to products, and perform research.\n\nThese four groups are the cornerstones of our society, the community of America. To be a sustainable community, the community requires sustainable agriculture. Respect and cooperation among these groups promotes just that.\n\n### Why Do You Need This Book?\n\n_Making Your Small Farm Profitable_ provides a blueprint for farmers. In one volume, I try to tie together the whole picture of farming, show new farmers what they can do and how to choose where to begin, and share my keys to success. I have been a farmer for 34 years and have made a lot of mistakes in that time; some people call this \"experience.\" My fifteen years as a publisher have exposed me to thousands of farm failures and farm success stories.
